- 👋 Hi, I’m @mmaatttee
- 👀 I’m interested in no-code and lo-code development and implementation (mainly Airtable, Softr, Bubble, Integromat, Zapier)
- 🌱 Always improving my JavaScript chops, especially in its API-integration functionality (Google Scripting, Airtable Scripting, etc.)
- 💞️ I’m openly looking to consult or work in-house on automations, workflow improvement, integrations, and in general anything that makes redundant work a thing of the past!
- 📫 How to reach me matteo.cossu@gmail.com
